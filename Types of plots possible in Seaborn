Now to talk about the types of plots possible in Seaborn:

pointplot
Syntax: sns.pointplot(x='Column_name',y='Column_name', data=df)
Note to remember: pointplot does not require x to be numbers, i.e it can be in words e.g Kelden however y has to be in numbers

ScatterPlot
Syntax: sns.lmplot(x='Column_name', y='Column_name', data=df)
Note to remember: ScatterPlot requires both x and y to be numbers

Histogram
Syntax: sns.distplot(df.Age) # That is the column Age inside the CSV file.
Note to remember: You only need to add the column and a histogram will you created for you
